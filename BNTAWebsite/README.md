## Introduction

Our plan was to make a landing page for the nandos restaurant.

## The process

To solve this problem we broke it down into manageable steps:
- We used Google docs to create a plan and a rough sketch of the webpage
- Next, we focused on creating the HTML
- Once completed, we then went on to style the page with CSS and JavaScript

### What We learned
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Organisation and Planning
- Task Management 
- Web Developement

### Continued development
We all thoroughly enjoyed this project and we gained a strong fundamental understanding of web developement. The next step is to keep this momentum and continue the journey of learning and applying our skills!

- [Nando's Website](https://www.nandos.co.uk/food/menu/) - Without this website, we would be nothing.
